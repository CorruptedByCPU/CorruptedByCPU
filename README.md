Welcome!

 Cyjon/Fern-Night is a simple project of multitasking operating system
for 64-bit processors from x86_64 family. Operating system doesn't have
its name, yet.

 A system that is detached from reality. Fully resident in memory.
(Yep, no installation on hard drive needed.)

PS: I'm looking for a *really* small C compiler that won't be bigger (in Bytes) than the current Cyjon/Fern-Night operating system :D **Good Luck!**
