Welcome!

 Foton (workname) is a hobby operating system based mostly on NOTHING. Lazy development begin at first day of year 2013 and Assembly language was choosen as first one. Order of namings is: Cyjon OS > Fern-Night and now Foton (all are worknames of OS project).

I don't plan to migrate any software from other operating systems, I write everything myself whenever possible.

Almost always available at my own channel of https://discord.gg/Zw2sGFyU
